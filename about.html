                <h2>Once upon a time...</h2>
                <p>The story starts with a young man from France who's father travelled the world for business. As a result young Pierre saw all the corners of the globe and lived in many different countries, but it was when his family settled in Uganda that he felt most at home. Here he would come to learn the ways of the third world in no city other than Kampala, the famed &#34;City That Never Sleeps&#34;. Here he would learn the art of negotiation by haggling with Bodaboda drivers about Mzungu price. When he wanted pocket money he turned to selling, or &#34;hustling&#34; as it&#39;s known in the streets of Uganda where the average person earns less than $2 per day. Here in this harsh economic climate our CEO was made.</p>
